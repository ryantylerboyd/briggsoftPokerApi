briggsoft poker Api Written in Java

Hello,
Welcome to Briggsoft poker API written in Java. While working with the api we wanted to convert it into java so here you go! This is an ongoing project so please do be aware of their updates. Also this api is written for a game server. We are going to build a custom GUI for the api later down the road that will be cool.
